const bio = `
  ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Srinjoy! I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft in Seattle, WA. I work on the [Microsoft Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens), an Augmented Reality headset designed for enterprises. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering ðŸ¤˜

  <br />

  While at UT, I conducted computer vision research in Human-Robot Interaction under Dr. Andrea Thomaz and Dr. Scott Niekum. I explored new 6 D.O.F. object tracking algorithms, gaze tracking methods and real-time environment mapping.
  I also helped develop software for the lab's custom humanoid robot named Poli!

  <br />

  Previously, I worked part-time as a Software Engineer at GitHub. I worked on projects such as [GitHub Classroom](https://github.com/srinjoym/classroom) and the GitHub Profile.
